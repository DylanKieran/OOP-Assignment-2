# OOP-Assignment-2
This is a github repository for my Object Orientated Programming assignment 2 for Year 2. We are required to create a classical game using the program processing. It should use the features that we have learnt so far.

For my project I wanted to create modern take on the classic game block breaker. I started my project by looking online for inspiration in terms of design aspects of my project. I found various images that inspired my game but ultimately it was my own design because I wanted it to feel unique.

## Key Features
- Different Types of tiles that inherit properties from a super class
- Rounds that progress endlessly and randomly with increasing difficulty
- Collision of the ball and Tiles
- Collision of the ball and paddle 
- Collision of the missile/enemy with the paddle and tiles
- Tiles that change depending on number of lives they have
- General Asthetic

### Start Screen
The Start screen I wanted to keep simple. I started by getting a font online that I thought would suit the asthetic. For the button I made a class that could be used over for other buttons throughout the game. When you hover over the start button it highlights and when pressed it changes the screen over to the game screen. The background carries on throughout the game its a series of small circles that are created in a double for loop, this just adds a nice detail to the game.
